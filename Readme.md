# React from 0 to Hero: 2-Day Professional Course

This course will guide you through the basics of Linux and the command line interface (CLI). Below are the key requirements to get started.

## Prerequisites for Linux + React:
1. **Basic Computer Skills**: Familiarity with basic operations like file management, navigating through an operating system, and using software applications.
2. **Access to a Linux Environment**: You will need access to a Linux system, which could be one of the following:
   - A physical Linux machine.
   - A Virtual Machine (VM) running Linux.
   - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on a Windows machine.
   - A cloud-based Linux environment (optional, but useful).

3. **Terminal/CLI Access**: You need to know how to open and operate a terminal. This could be:
   - A terminal emulator on Linux.
   - Bash, Zsh, or other shell environments on macOS.
   - WSL or PowerShell on Windows (with WSL installed).

4. **Text Editor**: You'll need a text editor to work with shell scripts or code. Some recommended options:
   - Terminal-based editors: Vim, Nano, Emacs.
   - Graphical editors: Visual Studio Code (with extensions for Linux and shell), Sublime Text, or Atom.

5. **No Prior Linux Experience Required**: This course is designed for beginners, so no prior knowledge of Linux or CLI is necessary, but enthusiasm and a willingness to learn are highly encouraged.

6. ** NVM (Node Version Manager) or NPM (Node Package Manager) **: You will need these tools to manage Node.js versions.

7. **Git**: You will need these tools to version control your code.


---

## Recommended Setup:
- **VSCode (Visual Studio Code)**: If you're using VSCode, consider installing the following extensions for a smoother workflow:
   - Remote - WSL (for WSL users).
   - ShellCheck (for shell scripting).
   - Markdown Preview Enhanced (if working with `.md` files).

---

By ensuring you have these tools and resources, youâ€™ll be well-equipped to navigate through the course and become comfortable using Linux and the command line.

---

### Session 4: React Lifecycle and `useEffect` (2 hours)
**Goal**: Understand the component lifecycle and how to use `useEffect`.
**Content**:
1. The lifecycle of a React component (Mounting, Updating, Unmounting).
2. Introduction to `useEffect` for side effects.
3. Fetching data from APIs with `useEffect`.
4. Cleaning up side effects in `useEffect`.

**Examples**:
- Fetch user data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it in a list.
- Implement a cleanup function in `useEffect` to demonstrate unmounting behavior.

---

### Session 5: Conditional Rendering and Lists (1 hour)
**Goal**: Learn how to conditionally render components and render lists of data.
**Content**:
1. Conditional rendering using ternary operators.
2. Rendering lists with `map()`.
3. Key prop importance in lists.

**Examples**:
- Display a message if the user list is empty.
- Render a list of users conditionally based on state.

---

### Homework/Project for Day 1:
Students will build a **basic Todo App**:
- Add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
- Store tasks in state.
- Use conditional rendering to filter completed tasks.

---

## Day 2: Advanced React & University Forum App (8 hours)

### Session 1: React Router (1.5 hours)
**Goal**: Learn how to navigate between different pages in a React app.
**Content**:
